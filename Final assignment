# Today's users receive too many emails every day, they need:
- Classify junk emails, emails from registered user services, work emails, emails from relatives.
- Know which emails need to be prioritized to answer first or dealt with first for work.

Analytic Approach: Classify emails from sender and content

Data requirements: List of email senders classified by work, spam, registration, family, friends. Header data, content of emails. A set of keywords to identify which topic the email content is related to. Time to receive mail and send feedback.

Data collection: inbox, sentbox, contact list, keyword list

Data Understanding and Preparation: Check the sender list to avoid confusing email addresses with the same domain.

Modeling and Evaluation:
- Create a model to classify emails into groups: spam, work, registration, family, social networks...
- Check if the emails are sorted by mistake between groups
- Emails in the work group will be checked for sender, sending time, number of emails from the same sender, and reply flow to notify whether they need to be prioritized or not prioritized.
